    <p> VitalTrack is ideal for schools, universities, organizations, and local communities. It protects against infections, alerts individuals to their own health needs, and helps authorities respond quickly to outbreaks</p>
    <p>VitalTrack aids in achieving UN SDG 3, specifically Target 3.d, by swiftly detecting symptoms of global health risks. It detects fever and low oxygen levels, indicating potential respiratory or circulatory issues. The gathered data helps experts create health guidelines, monitor populations, and prevent health risks. VitalTrack promotes equitable healthcare with its potential to reach underserved populations, including remote areas and low-resource communities, providing timely medical attention.</p>
